## üß™ How to Run
From the project root directory, type:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## üíª Developers
While working on this project, it is often convenient to check the result of the extracted card (stored as a dict). There is a helper method in `tests/debug.py` that accomplishes this.

From the project root directory, type `python -m tests.debug "<id>"` where `<id>` is the unique ID number for each card (e.g. A1 001)

Example:
   ```bash
    python -m tests.debug "A1 001"
   ```
   ```json
   {
     "number": "A1 001",
     "name": "Bulbasaur",
     "rarity": "‚óá",
     "stage": "Basic",
     "HP": "70",
     "type": "Grass",
     "weakness": "Fire",
     "retreat_cost": "1",
     "ultra_beast": "No",
     "generation": "1",
     "illustrator": "Narumi Sato",
